# Numerical Techniques for Engineers (NTE) - C++ Library

A modern C++ library that provides numerical methods and techniques commonly used by engineers.

⚠️ **Note**:  
The library now requires **`InOut.hpp V2`** instead of `InOut.hpp V1`.  
Version 2 introduces a cleaner and more professional I/O handling system.

## ✨ Features
- Root finding, numerical integration, differentiation, interpolation, linear algebra.
- Written in **C++23**.
- Header-only design for easy integration.
- Tested with **GoogleTest**.
- Improved **InOut.hpp V2** for input/output operations.
