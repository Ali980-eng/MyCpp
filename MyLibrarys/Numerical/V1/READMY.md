# Numerical Techniques for Engineers (NTE) - C++ Library

A modern C++ library that provides numerical methods and techniques commonly used by engineers, such as:
- Root finding (Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant)
- Numerical integration (Trapezoidal rule, Simpsonâ€™s rule, Gaussian quadrature)
- Numerical differentiation
- Linear algebra utilities (matrix operations, solving linear systems)
- Interpolation and curve fitting

## âœ¨ Features
- Written in **C++23**
- Header-only (easy to integrate)
- Focus on **readability** and **performance**
- Tested with **GoogleTest**

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Just clone this repository and include the `include/` folder in your project:

```bash
