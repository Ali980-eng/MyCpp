# MyLibrarys

This repository contains a collection of C++ libraries that I am developing as part of my personal and professional growth in software development. The goal of this project is to build a wide range of reusable libraries while exploring modern C++ features (C++23 and beyond), design principles, and programming techniques.

## Folder Structure

Each library resides in its own directory and contains multiple versioned subfolders. Version folders are named using the format `V1`, `V2`, ..., `Vn`:

MyLibrarys/
│
├── MyLibraryName1/
│ ├── V1/ ← First release
│ ├── V2/ ← Second release
│ └── ...
│
├── MyLibraryName2/
│ ├── V1/
│ └── V2/
│
└── ...

## Versioning Policy

- **V1**: First version of the library.
- **V2**: An improved or modified version of V1.
- **V3...Vn**: Continued development with optimizations, added features, or code refactoring.
- Each version may optionally include a `CHANGELOG.md` file to document changes.

## Objectives

- Practice writing clean and maintainable C++ code.
- Apply software design principles such as SOLID.
- Explore and utilize modern C++ standard libraries and language features.
- Build libraries that are reusable, modular, and extensible.

## Final Goal

Although this repository started as a learning and experimentation space, the **ultimate goal** is for these libraries to become **practically usable in real-world applications** and projects.

## Notes

- All code is written and organized according to my personal development style and preferences.
- This is an evolving project, and structure or design decisions may change over time.
