# vector_tools.hpp

A custom C++ header-only library offering a collection of tools and utility objects for working with vectors.
The library is designed for learning and experimental purposes, featuring self-contained implementations of basic data structures and operations.

## 📦 Features

- Reverse a vector (`reverse_vec`)
- Generate Fibonacci sequence as a vector (`FibonacciSequence`)
- Get the index of the last element (`vec_end`)
- Compare two vectors for equality (`same_vec`)
- Support for 2D and 3D vector types (`vector_2d`, `vector_3d`)
- Dual vector container (`VecPair`) for holding two related vectors
- List-like vector implementation (`VecList`)

## 🚧 Development Phases

This library was built with a structured approach:

1. **Planning & Idea Generation**
2. **Design of Class Structures & API**
3. **Implementation & Debugging**
4. **Function Documentation (AI-assisted)**
5. **Testing & Iterative Refinement**

All algorithm logic and class design were implemented independently.

## 🔍 Status

The core structure of the library is complete, but additional validation is being conducted through a comprehensive test suite. The repository will be released once all unit tests are finalized.

## 📁 File Structure

```
vector_tools.hpp   <- Main header file
example.cpp        <- (planned) example usage and test code
```
