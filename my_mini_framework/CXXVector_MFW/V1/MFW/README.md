# CXXVector (formerly `vector_tools.hpp`)

**CXXVector** is a lightweight mini-framework focused on enhancing and extending the capabilities of C++ vectors.  
It provides a set of specialized headers for multidimensional vectors, paired vectors, vector utilities, and a unified interface.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

Unlike `std::vector`, this framework does not reinvent the data structure.  
Instead, it **wraps and extends `std::vector`** to provide additional functionality and abstractions,  
making it easier to work with multidimensional, paired, and functional-style vector operations.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Components

### 1. `multidimensional_vector.hpp`
Provides tools for multidimensional vectors:
- `uvt::vector<T>` â€” wrapper around `std::vector<T>`.
- `uvt::vector_2d<T>` â€” two-dimensional vectors.
- `uvt::vector_3d<T>` â€” three-dimensional vectors.

> Note: These are **not new containers**, but wrappers around `std::vector` that add new features and simplified handling.

---

### 2. `pair_vector.hpp`
Provides data structures for paired vectors:
- `uvt::pair_v<T>` â€” a pair of vectors holding the **same type**.
- `uvt::pair__v<T1, T2>` â€” a pair of vectors holding **different types**.

These abstractions are useful for managing correlated vector data.

---

### 3. `vector_functions.hpp`
A collection of utility functions for working with vectors:
- `sub_v()` â€” extract sub-vectors.  
- `v_end()` â€” advanced handling of vector endings.  
- `...and more`.

---

### 4. `CXXVector.hpp`
The **main entry point** of the framework:
- Includes all other headers with a single `#include`.
- Adds extra features such as **`vstream`**, which allows treating a vector as a data stream.

---

## âœ¨ Key Features
- Lightweight (~5500 lines of code with documentation).
- Extends `std::vector` without replacing it.  
- Multidimensional vector support.  
- Paired vector types for correlated data.  
- Functional utilities for vector manipulation.  
- Stream-like abstraction for vectors.
